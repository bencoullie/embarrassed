# Embarrassed
A chrome addon to hide your weebyness on youtube.

## What does it do?
Basically replaces any anime music video (just the visuals) with a still image of a person learning to shave their beard (🤷‍♂️). 

Still kinda embarrasing but a different kind of embarrassment, a more manageable one. 

## Why?
Sometimes you want to listen to a banger at work but don't have the confidence you won't accidentally tab to it while a co-worker is peering over your shoulder.

## How does it work?
Right now its simple af. It just looks for key words in the video title and if it finds them (such as 'anime') it will replace the video image.
